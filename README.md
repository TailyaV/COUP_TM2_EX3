##README FILE- COUP

##Project Overview
This is a C++ implementation of the strategic game Coup. The project supports 2 to 6 players and includes full game mechanics (GUI), turn management, and role-specific actions.
 The goal of each player in the game is to be the last one standing and thus be recognized as the winner.
 The logic of the game is encapsulated in the game manager class, and each player is assigned a role represented by a subclass of the player base class (such as governor, judge, spy, baron, General, and Merchant.).
The player class contains the 6 basic actions of the game, and each inheriting class, according to its role, performs additional and special actions according to the role it fulfills.

##Setup and Compilation
To compile and run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code use a C++ compiler.
3. Options: 
make Main- to run the demo file.
make test- to run the unit test.
make valgrind- memory leak testing using valgrind.
make clean- deletes all irrelevant files after running.
4. When starting the game, the user will be required to write a name for each player and after writing each name, press the ENTER button on the keyboard.
 (Only after all ENTER presses have been pressed will the game be able to run.)
5. A red mark on a player's button will indicate that it is the marked player's turn.
